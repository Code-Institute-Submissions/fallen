<h3>Write It by Hand</h3>
<p>Despite relying on technology for so much, keep things old school with your daily gratitude list and journal. This means grabbing a pen or pencil and writing things down by hand, on paper. There's something about the kinetic process of noting it in scripture that makes you approach your list with thoughtfulness and awareness. When you feel each and every word being written down on paper, it connects you to that sentiment. Try it and see.</p>
    <h4>Writing a gratitude list</h4>
    "I have a place to sleep." <br>
    "I ate today."<br>
    "I have a good heart."<br>
    "I drink clean water."<br>
    "I strive to be better."<br>
    "I wish others well."<br>
    "I am a good person."<br>
    "I have nice clothes."<br>
    "I am breathing."<br>
    "Someone cares for me."<br>
    "Something made me smile today"<br>
    "Something funny that made me laugh"<br>
