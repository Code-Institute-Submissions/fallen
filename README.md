# CHANGE IS GOOD

## App to help connect addicts who want to recover. 

## Key.
1. Users - people suffering from addiction and looking for solutions
2. Contributors- people who are recovering from addiction and have some methods to suggest as a means to recover.


The aim of this project was to create an app which presents the user with stories similar to their own from people who have found a solution.
The idea came from the milestone3 project guideline which suggested we make an app which stores recipes. 
The automatic thought is to develop an app which stores cooking recipes but the term recipe can apply to other structured methods.

Having myself volunteered helping alcoholics, drug addicts and sex/love addicts for alomst 20 years, I know that the current treatments in place do not work for the majority of people.
New approaches are necessary and the gathering of data is currently not independent. Many of the current recovery models have been set up to support men. In particular male offernders.
The fear of social services being involved prevents many mothers from seeking the help they desperately need. This is believed to contribute to the 
fact that momen may be more likely to go to A&E or die from overdose or other effects of certain substances.
The difficulty women with children have attending 12 step meetings or other recovery programmes reliably means fresh methods need to be devloped to support these women.
Not neglecting men, many of whom state that their social anxiety prevents them in engaging with currently favoured treatment programs which are geared towards group therapy and effectively revealing all your past and inner most thoughts to an audience.


Latest studies reveal that addiction may be the direct result of lack of human connection. 
Addiction is a desperate and lonely place.
The belief that you are alone and the only one to have suffered the same experiences is the final song of many addicts who tragically die. Often leaving young children to the social care system. 
Addiction presents with the symptom of a feeling uniqueness, a sense of being special and different. Both a sense of grandiosity  and the flip side of pitifully low self esteem are often present. 
If this is not tackled this pattern of thinking will end in escalating drug use inevitably leading to prison, hospitalisation, institutions or death by suicide, accident or violence.

This project will 
1. Offer an environment where isolated people suffering with addiction issues can reach out. 
2. Offer a catalogue of solutions in the form of stories written by people who have beaten their addiction
3. Gather data as to what works relative to the individual circumstances, upbringing, support structure, parental/societital influences, family history and environment. Many other factors can easily be explored by presenting them  within the questionnaires to gather facts of statistical significance. 


The data collected by the app can then be used to highlight patterns that lead to recovery in some sufferers may cause suicide and death in another.
As the data base expands facts can be shown to support how, for example, 36 year old mother of 2 with an alcohol problem and a history of compulsive over achieving, chronic stress, neglect and starvation as a child recovered from an alcohol and prescription drug dependence.
Her recovery may need the opposite methods to that of a 22 year old man, sexually abused as a child who is addicted to heroin since being 11. 

This app will filter out backgrounds and differences that are of no interest or relevance to the user. Focusing on bespoke methods that could work for them being both proven so realistic and achievable. 
Presenting the user with similarities and not differences amongst the success stories.


## UX
### User stories and anticiapted preferences considered at each stage and contained within this section.
#### Aim provide a service and connection to users who are trying to recover from addiction. Collect data to help develop new methods for tackling the addiction crisis. Addiction featured will include gaming, social media, porn and other modern day issues.
**The strategy plan**The aim of this project was to create an app which presents the user with stories similar to their own from people who have found a solution.

USER SECTION- Those still suffering from addiction

The user will be asked a series of direct questions with different predetermined options. The answers to these questions will be assigned an integer which will be stored in the database so that processing the data will be simplified. 

CONTRIBUTOR SECTION= Those sharing their story having recovered from addiction

The contributors to the information provided to the users will be addicts in recovery who share their stories and demonstrate which methods they used to get sober/clean and free of the destructive patterns that have taken over their lives.
The contributors will be asked more general questions because
- With an open forum, it is anticipated that a lot more methods may be offered for consideration that haven't been thought of previosuly. Asking specific questions and tailoring the responses will limit the collection of data to what is previously know to cause and heal addiction. A fresh approach needs to be found.
- The stories presented will appear more personal, true and relatable if they are in the contibutors own words.
- The questions which provoke thought may be more engaging for the contibutor so making them more likely to complete and submit the form. 

ADMIN SECTION- Editting and deleting stories which may to too graphic, false or inappropriate.

A hard to find tab labelled admin will link to a form to edit the contributor story. The option to delete will be stored there too. 
Currently the strategy offers total anonymity and no login is required. This is expected to remain the case for the user. 
No login is deemed necessary for contributors at this point. We will be keen to gather as many recovery successs stories as possible so the ease of this process will be imperative. Any barriers may limit the available information and select for a specific type of contibutor which will influence the data collected.
There is no login currently for admin as whole. There is no requirement for login to be included for the project but without having launched the app we can not predict whether this may need to be added for sure. The reasonning is that if an offensive recovery story is added it does not need to wait for me to find out and remove it.
Anyone can remove it who is offended by it. There is an appreciation that this may lead to malicious emptying of the database but while the sale of the project is still small the threat is considered small.

The community interest goals of this website are
- To collect data useful to the NHS, drug treatment agencies and private recovery organisations.
- To provide hope, comfort and a community for people trying to recover from addiction and isolation.
- To help mothers who are too afraid to get the help they need because of the threat that their children may be removed by social services.
- many currently treatments available are for the later stages of addiction when the addict has become a threat to themselves or others. The is little funding available for prevention. 
Early intervention may be proven to stop of the problem escalating so funding can be attracted to prevention rather than cure.. 
**The scope plan**
Re-scoping followed feedack from tutors and my mentor, plus, when I asked recovered addicts to fill in the forms I had designed they lost interest half way through which would lead to aborted efforts too often.
The inital scope was ambitious and had features added, for example a diary as jounralling is known to help recovering addicts.
Originally the scope included a lot of recovery information within the app but this is now selected by a series of links within the home page and in the footer. 
There were features planned that would attract people in recvery to the site to motivate them to provide their stories, for example, a gratitude list which is known to maintain good mental health in recovery.
Following research the project was simplified with additional features planned for the future at a point they are deemed necessary.

The final scope, based on information from the strategy plane and an understanding of how chaotic addicts are is a simplified information gathering process followed by the presentation of the information in the form of:
- illustrated cards leading to individual story details. 
- Alternatively the user can generate a bespoke list using a filter dropdown men realting to their selected criteria. This is currently limited to one criteria, namely their own addiction. As the number of stories grows, I will add more filters so that the user is not overfaced with too many stories to process. Currently if I add more than one filter the list generated will be empty.
= I have also left a link in the nav bar so that users can generate a list of every story. It is often intersting to see the similarities between e.g. alcohol and sex addiciton. 

This project suited the MongoDB store because of it's fexibility and scalabilty. The agility allowing fields to vary from document to document means that is is suitable for evolving with the project. The scope of the project anticipates the need to change and react quickly, for example, the questions may need to change regularly to gather the most useful data and provide the best solutions to our users.
If the project is deemed to be useful for the recovery community it would need to scale quickly.

The scope of the project has been designed so that it is not throttles by the need for admin and processing but it can grwo organically and is moderated by admin rather than stunted by it.

**The Structure plane**:. Considering IA- Information Architecture, the structure has been kept as simple as possible on the welcome page, considering the attention span of the users. 
User stories dictated the chosen structure.
The expected nav bar backs up the buttons in the sections so that the user has a familiar method to access different sections of the site. 
Accessing the same information from a different part of the site , and in a different way (lists rather than cards containing images) is believed to be a benefit , enabling the user to find what they need effortlessly and intuitively.

**The Skeleton plane**
The skeleton is currently as follows:
- A main page with links to external resources, a nav bar linking to  different forms (listed below).
Within the main page, dropdown menu offers the user the ability to filter the stories to list those most relevant to them. 
They are then presented with a list of stories they can read. 
Within the main page the story cards link to a details story . one story per page. The main content of the page is the data stored in MongoDB which is pulled in to the grid.
- forms
1. A second page containing a simple collapsible form for the user to complete their story with prompted questions and a selction of answers.
2. A third page containing a list of contributor's recoverys stories
3. A third page form at add contributor recovery stories.
4. 
5. The admin link in the footer linking to the form offering edit and delete functionality.

**The Surface plane**
Modern design conventions were balanced with the desire to keep the interest and focus of the user and the contributor, both of which are not conventional  by their natures.
- A main page with a lot of imagery, quotes and contributor recovery stories. 
Images have been chosen to appeal to the users while presenting a simple message.
The decision was made to auto add an image chosen to reflect each type of the 21 addictions tackled on this app.
This is thought to offer a pattern to the user that they will connect within
- the forms to complete were kept very simple. Focus to be kept on the information. The font is easy to read and the colours are muted.
As we are trying to gather as much information as possible it is the intial decidion to only add a character limit to the alias.
The functionaility of the forms took precendence. 
The presentation of the list of stories after filtering has been kept raw. The focus is then kept on the information. The users can be easily distracted assuming they are suffering from addiction of some type.
At the point of submission we believe the story detail page has been laid out to best display the most relevant solutions and information immediately and make it obvious to the user. 
This will be adapted quickly as the questions may change and the way they are presented may not benefit the user and help the informatin to be absorbed.
The idea of recovery being a recipe presented to the user in text and images only seems to click less than half the time. 
In terms of this project I hope the idea make sense but it may not prove an effective message in the real world. The surface would then change and the hero image on the home page would be replaced.


## How to use
1. -  Users will be invited to  'TELL YOU STORY'. A link in the nav bar and a button within the home page direct the user to the 'tell your story' form. 
- A simple form guides the user through a  series of questions using select options to make the process effortless.

2. - Users can use a dropdown to filter and find stories written by people with a similar problem habit or addiction to their own. 
Depending on how the questions are answered the user is presented with a series of stories from the data base written by addicts who are (12 months being considered as time frame) free from dependence. 
 3. The whole collection of user stories, that have been gathered and inputted during development of the app initally will be presented.
 If the user clicks on the view story link in the card they will be presented with a recovery recipe of all the information held for that user story.  
4. A contributor fills in their story using the link 'share you recovery in the nav bar. 
when they submit the form it is added to the mongoDB and then displayed on the app as cards on the home page and within a list found by clicking on recovery stories in the nav bar

 provides the ingredients and this app presents the method to get to their tailored recovery recipe from the database. 
but then the additional stries to be added by clicking
