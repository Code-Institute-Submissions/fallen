##App to help connect addicts who want to recover. 

Latest studies reveal that addiction may be the direct result of lack of human connection. 
Addiction is a desperate and lonely place.
The belief that you are alone and the only one to have suffered the same experiences is the final song of many addicts who tragically die. Often leaving young children to the social care system. 
Addiction presents with the symptom of a feeling uniqueness, a sense of being special and different. Both a sense of grandiosity  and the flip side of pitifully low self esteem are often present. 
If this is not tackled this pattern of thinking will end in escalating drug use inevitably leading to prison, hospitalisation, institutions or death by suicide, accident or violence.

This app is designed to treat the thinking that results in the feelings that ultimately lead to loss of hope and self destructive behaviours.
The aim is to present the user with stories similar to their own from people who have recovered from addiction.

The data collected by the app can then be used to highlight patterns that lead to recovery in some sufferers may cause suicide and death in another.
As the data base expands facts can be shown to support how, for example, 36 year old mother of 2 with an alcohol problem and a history of compulsive over achieving, chronic stress, neglect and starvation as a child recovered from an alcohol and prescription drug dependence.
Her recovery may need the opposite methods to that of a 22 year old man, sexually abused as a child who is addicted to heroin since being 11. 

This app will filter out backgrounds and differences that are of no relevance to the user. presenting them with similarities and not differences amongst the success stories.


##How to use

Users will be asked a series of questions.
Depending on how the questions are answered the user is presented with a series of stories from the data base written by addicts who are 12 months free from dependence. 

I would almost describe it as a recovery recipe. 
User provides the ingredients and this app presents the method to get to their tailored recovery recipe from the database.
